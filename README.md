XRecorder (for Xperia Marshmallow and higher)
=============================================

This Xposed module was originally developed by cinhoo but it stopped working since Marshmallow. I only use the source code and added support for Marshmallow and later Xperia firmware.

Installation instructions:
1. Install the module
2. Run Xposed Installer and enable the module XRecorder (for Xperia Marshmallow and higher)
3. Flash the XZ3_CallRecording_signed.zip in recovery
4. Reboot the phone
